# transformer_geometrical_analysis
Final project of the course Laboratory of Computational Physics (MOD. B) from the Physics of Data Master's Degree program at Università degli Studi di Padova. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a geometrical analysis of how the embedding space is transformed inside the GPT-2 large transformer-based language model.
