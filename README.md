# transformer_geometrical_analysis
Final project of the course Laboratory of Computational Physics (MOD. B) from the Physics of Data Master's Degree program at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a geometrical analysis of how the data is transformed inside the GPT-2 large transformer-based language model's embedding space.
